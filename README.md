# Haskell-Work

Hello future me! This reposatory is from the few books that I am about the haskell programming language. 

Book 1: Programming in Haskell 
Book 2: Haskell in Depth
Website 1: haskell.com

I will be learning from these source. Each source will be numbered by chapter so I can see the original document and how I answered the questions. 

More to come!
