# Haskell-Work

Hello future me! This reposatory is from the few books that I am about the haskell programming language. 

Book 1: Programming in Haskell  
Book 2: Haskell in Depth  
Book 3: Real World Haskell, https://book.realworldhaskell.org/  
Website 1: haskell.com  
Website 2: Learn you a haskell for great good 

Course 1: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/  
readings, Leearn you a haskell and real world haskell 

I will be learning from these source. Each source will be numbered by chapter so I can see the original document and how I answered the questions. 

More to come!
